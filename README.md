# Nav Bar Idea for Founder Grants

## Dependencies

>  ``` npm i react-dom ``` (in case it is not carried over in fork)

## DevDependencies

> ``` npm i ```
> ``` npm i node-sass  ```

- This is an ideal nav bar that we would like to provide our stake holder, Zak Slayback
- The nav bar will have a few differences depending on the user
  - For example: An admin needs a "Edit Grants" & "Edit Mods" link where users and mods will not have access to those links.
